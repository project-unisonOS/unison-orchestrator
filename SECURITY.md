# Security

This repository is part of the UnisonOS project and participates in the edge-first, policy-driven security model described in the public docs.

For overall security guidance, including how policy, consent, and wake-word features are handled, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you discover a security issue in the orchestrator, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
